## Overview

Welcome to my minimal blog card project!

üß† What I learned:
- How to structure semantic HTML for readability and accessibility.
- Styling clean layouts using CSS variables and box shadows.
- Responsive design principles using flexbox.

üí° Wisdom:
Sometimes, less is more. A well-crafted simple card can say more than a complex UI when it‚Äôs designed with intention and clarity.

Hope you enjoy it!

### What I learned

This project helped me understand and practice several key front-end development concepts:

1. üìê **CSS Layout & Design**:
   - Learned how to build clean, minimal layouts using **Flexbox**.
   - Practiced using **CSS variables** (`:root`) for consistent color theming.
   - Designed a responsive card component with **box shadows**, **border radius**, and **padding** to create a modern UI look.

   Example:
   ```css
   :root {
     --purple-light: #f3e8ff;
     --purple: #6a0dad;
   }

   .box {
     box-shadow: 8px 8px 20px 0 rgba(85, 85, 85, 0.08);
     border-radius: 16px;
   }

### Useful resources

üìö Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)  
  This helped me understand how to use Flexbox for centering and aligning items on the page. The diagrams and examples were super clear and practical.

- [CSS Tricks - Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)  
  A great visual reference I kept coming back to while working on the layout. The explanations are concise and easy to follow.

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)  
  I used this to explore clean, readable font options like *Inter* and *Roboto*. It makes a big difference in the overall look of the card.

- [devChallenges.io](https://www.devchallenges.io/)  
  The challenge itself gave me a focused task with real-world relevance, which helped me improve both my design thinking and coding skills.


### Built with

This project was created using the following technologies and tools:

- **HTML5** ‚Äì For building the semantic structure of the blog card.
- **CSS3** ‚Äì For styling, layout, and responsive design using Flexbox, custom properties (variables), and box shadows.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** ‚Äì *(Not used in this project, but could be added for interactivity in the future)*.
- **VS Code** ‚Äì My code editor of choice, with helpful extensions like Live Server and Prettier.
- **devChallenges.io** ‚Äì For the challenge prompt and design inspiration.
